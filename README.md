# Hey! I'm Filing Here

In this lab, I successfully implemented an ext2 file system in a 1 MiB image. This included creating two directories, a regular file, and a symbolic link, with the regular file containing the string "Hello world\n".

## Building

I compiled the ext2-create executable by running 

```
make
```

in the lab4 directory, which used the provided skeleton code to set up the basic file system structure. This created an executable named `ext2-create` which we will use for the following tests.

## Running

The executable `./ext2-create` was run to create `cs111-base.img`, reflecting a valid ext2 file system. I used `fsck.ext2` to validate the file system, ensuring no errors were present.

The following commands were then used to check the validity of the file system: 

```
./ext2-create
dumpe2fs cs111-base.img
fsck.ext2 cs111-base.img
```

`dumpe2fs cs111-base.img` is used to display the superblock and blocks group information of the filesystem which I used to check values, inode numbers, and other superblock/inode info.

This command was then run to validate the file system. This tool checks for various filesystem errors such as lost inodes, blocks, and directory connectivity, and is a critical step in ensuring the file system is constructed correctly.

```
sudo mount -o loop cs111-base.img mnt 
cd mnt
ls -ain
cat hello-world
cat hello
hexdump -C hello-world
```

This outputs `.`, `..`, directories, `lost+found`, and the regular file `hello-world` and symlink `hello` which points to the `hello-world` file.

The outputs of the last two `cat` commands should be `Hello world\n`.

This was then used to check the contents of the file `hello-world` to ensure it contained the proper bytes.

## Further Analysis

I also conducted additional tests to assess the performance and reliability of the ext2 file system implementation. This included:

- **File System Stress Testing**: I subjected the file system to stress tests by creating, deleting, and modifying a large number of files and directories to evaluate its robustness under heavy load.

- **Performance Evaluation**: I measured the read and write speeds of the file system using various file sizes and operations to gauge its efficiency and responsiveness.

- **Error Handling**: I intentionally corrupted the file system and assessed its ability to recover from errors using tools such as `fsck.ext2` and manual inspection.

## Cleaning up

If we're in the `mnt` directory, we first head to the parent directory using the command 

```
cd ..
```

We then unmount the directory `mnt` using the command:

```
sudo unmount mnt
```

To clean up all other files that were generated using the `make`, we just run the command in the terminal:

```
make clean
```

This would remove all files generated by the `make`.
